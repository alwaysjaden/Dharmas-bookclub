## PROJECT-1

The application is disigned for our Book Store Client to offer their customers a sleek and simple webpage to search for new book suggestions. Customers can enjoy methods to dynmaically create a short list of books to peruse. 1st, they may utilize our search bar to input their desired Author; upon reciept of input, we utilize Google's book API to generate findings and display them via dynamically created elements. 2nd, customers may be directed to our "Best Sellers" tab to have the application display New York Time's top 5 Best Sellers via dynamically created elements. At homepage, customers can view the search bar and one randomly suggested option from the NYT's best sellers list as a quick alternate suggestion rather than relying on inputting a specific author. 

All book images include a link to either NYTimes or Google Book's API object's URL for purchase. Some image links may not work due to API lacking live URL information.
